## Hi there!

I am a random person with a wide range of interest:
`Coding`, `Marketing`, `Business Process Improvement`, `Personal development`.

Above all, Sahaja Yoga is my purpose, free and unique way to balance yourself!

## Tech

A few stuff that I can handle:
- System architect
- Backend API (`Django`, `Django Rest`)
- DevOps
- Chatbot


## Projects
List of stuff that I worked on before, or what I'm working on right now/planning to touch soon:

- [FiberX] **Backend API** (`Django`/`Django Rest`)
- [thespoke] **Backend API** (`Django`/`Django Rest`)
- [Hocngon](https://hocngon.com)
- [Getgoru mobile app](http://www.getgoru.com/): **Backend API** (`Django`/`Django Rest`), **Server architect**

### What I want to do
Why want? 'cause I don't have enough resourse (time/money) for it, yet! 
- [Vietnamese] **Children portal** A portal for children related information in Vietnamese:
	- Raising children info: Information relating to rasing children, for different age groups.
	- Videos for children: all videos are being moderated, and classified for different age groups and purposed.
	- Book reviews
- **Business Ideas:** I believe ideas alone won't bring you anywhere. You'll need execution, and well, partners, and feedback. A site to share start-up ideas, to find partners, or just to request for something.
