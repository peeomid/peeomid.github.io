## Hi there!

I'm Luan, a development consultant, based in Vietnam.

A few stuff that I normally work on:
- System architect
- Backend development (`Django`, `Django Rest`)
- API integration
- SEO Optimization

So if you're in situations like following, drop me an email.
- Have a business idea, but not too sure where to start, how to design or development?
- Want to build a mobile/web application, and need to build API for that quickly (what helps the application manage information at the back)
- Integrate your system with other systems, say getting hotel information from Agoda, or adding payment in.

## Projects
Some projects I worked on before:

- [[Getgoru](http://www.getgoru.com/)]: (`Django`/`Django Rest`)
This is a mobile app that allows users to browse hotels and restaurants, and do booking in that single app, without having to go to different apps. Developed its backend API, integrating it with Agoda for hotel information and booking.
- [XiberX] **Backend API** (`Django`/`Django Rest`)
This app manages properties and tenants. Bootstraped the project and developed the 1st phase of its backend API.
- [[thespoke](http://thespoke.co)] **Backend API** (`Django`/`Django Rest`)
This app allows searching for, and bookmarking movie and restaurant information. Developed its backend API and integration.
- [[Snapshop](https://snapshop.com)] **Backend API** (`Django`/`Django Rest`)
E-commerce Mobile app for fashion.

I also have a few personal projects, some of them:
- [[Oduoc](https://oduoc.com)] Content site for fashion-related topics
- [[Choidii](https://choidii.com)] Travel plans
