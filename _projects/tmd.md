## What it is
`tmd` is a terminal-first task manager that uses plain Markdown files. It lets you keep todos close to your notes while still giving you powerful search, filters, and an interactive TUI.

## Why it exists
If you keep tasks across multiple projects and markdown files, `tmd` lets you query them like a database without leaving your editor. It is designed for text-first workflows, AI tooling, and people who prefer keyboard-driven task management.

## Who it is for
- Developers who want a CLI todo manager.
- Teams or individuals using Markdown for project notes.
- Anyone who wants task queries like `bucket:today` or `energy:low`.

## Key features
- Markdown-backed todos in any editor
- Interactive TUI with vim-style navigation
- Filters by project, tags, due date, energy, and more
- JSON output for automation and AI agents
- Works well with Obsidian vaults

## Install
```bash
npm install -g todosmd
```
